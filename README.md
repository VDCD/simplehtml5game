# simplehtml5game
This is a simple old school shooter. I developed it to try Canvas &amp; sound handling in HTML5

You can play it here :  https://simplehtml5game.herokuapp.com/ 

Move your ship with ZQSD or WASD (both work !).
Might take a phew seconds to load depending on your connection, because of the images & sounds required to play.
