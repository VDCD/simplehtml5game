# simplehtml5game

##Why?
  This is a very simple old school shooter. I developed it to try Canvas &amp; sound handling in HTML5

###Can I try it?
  Of course ! You can play here :  https://simplehtml5game.herokuapp.com/ 

###How can i play?
  Move your ship with ZQSD or WASD (both work !).
  Might take a phew seconds to load depending on your connection, because of the images & sounds required to play.
