# simplehtml5game

##Why?
  This is a very simple old school shooter. I developed it to try Canvas &amp; sound handling in HTML5

###Can I try it?
  Of course ! You can play here :  https://simplehtml5game.herokuapp.com/ 

###How can i play?
  Move your ship with ZQSD or WASD (both work !).
  Press Space to fire bullets.
  You can go from one edge to the other (just continue in the direction of the edge, you'll be "teleported" on the other side).
  Might take a phew seconds to load depending on your connection, because of the images & sounds required to play.
